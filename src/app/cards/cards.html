      Making websites when browsers were still figuring it out

      <p>Before CSS was standardized, before social media existed, I was hosting my first site on a university server. The navigation was unrolled toilet paper. The characters guiding you through the experience? Cow & Chicken and the Red Guy. If that sounds chaotic, that's because it was — and I loved it.</p>
      <p>I was young, obsessed with UI, and just building things to learn. But then something unexpected happened. A small web design company reached out. It felt like a prank at first — my university colleagues playing a joke on me — but it was real. They wanted to hire me.</p>
      <p>There were about three or four of us. Two designers, two developers, everyone new to this industry but hungry. We were building in this wild moment when every business suddenly needed a website and there were no shortcuts, no templates, no platforms. We built ruse.net, basically a local version of Yahoo for the town. It was messy and fun and we had no idea what we were doing, which meant we could try anything.</p>      
      <p>That moment taught me something I've never forgotten: the best work happens when you're just a small team figuring it out together, when the stakes feel low enough to play with but high enough to matter.</p>

      <p>When my company decided everyone needed a photo for their badges, I saw an opportunity. I rented lights and softboxes for the first time — friends at the camera store gave me a quick crash course and sent me off. Over two or three days, I shot everyone in both office buildings.</p>
      <p>That was supposed to be it. But people kept asking if I'd do theirs too. So for the next 12 years, I became the person who photographed every new hire on their first day. 1400+ portraits.</p>
      <p>I was never the most technical photographer. But I learned something much more valuable: how to see someone. How to listen. How to give someone a few minutes where they felt genuinely seen. How to find their best angle, not just technically but emotionally — that moment where they realized they looked better than they thought they would.</p>
      <p>I learned how different the energy shifts with one person versus a small group versus twenty people. How to hold attention. How to make someone comfortable enough to be themselves in front of a camera. Those skills — reading people, navigating dynamics, making space for different personalities — they became essential later. Especially in meetings where I had to navigate stakeholders, egos, and competing visions.</p>
      <p>Photography was the vehicle. But what I was really practicing was seeing people.</p>

      One pane of glass beats wizards and modals

      <p>We had a UI problem: workspace modeling was a mess of wizards, modals, and jumping between different screens. Users had to go in and out constantly. It was painful to watch.</p>
      <p>Then someone on the team showed us Tableau. The power of it wasn't the data visualization — it was the interface philosophy. One pane of glass. You pull ingredients from different areas, you modify your final state, everything visible at once. No more hopping through layers.</p>
      <p>That idea sparked something. We weren't officially designers on the team, but we saw the UX problem and we saw the solution. We built a proof of concept, prototyped it, and showed it to the stakeholders. It was one of those moments where you realize good thinking beats everything else. They bought it.</p>
      <p>When we delivered the product, Eric Rider suggested we file for a patent. A year later — November 2015 — it was official. "A Method Of Workspace Modeling." Looking back, that patent wasn't really about the technical innovation. It was proof that I could see a problem, find inspiration, and think through a solution. It was me being a designer, even before I had the title.</p>

      From C++ to Flex to HTML5: watching a platform evolve
    </ng-container>
    <ng-container dialogContent>
      <p>vSphere started as a desktop C++ application. People loved it. Then around 2008, there was a big push: bring it to the web. This was the Flex era, before Steve Jobs killed Flash with a single post.</p>
      <p>I got a glimpse into that first transition. A designer on the team was evaluating the whole Flex approach — doing site visits, interviews, heuristic analysis, the whole design-by-the-book process. While helping her prototype concepts in Flex, I started learning about design thinking, the actual methodology behind good design. She recommended books, shared frameworks. I was curious and hungry to learn.</p>
      <p>But Flex didn't last. Soon after, we started yet another overhaul: Flex to HTML5. By then, my HTML and CSS skills had become something the team needed. I was brought in to help navigate the transition — fixing bugs, cleaning things up, stabilizing a product being rebuilt in a new technology while people were still using it.</p>
      <p>That's when I learned what enterprise product work really meant. It's not about the perfect rewrite. It's about managing complexity, prioritizing fixes, adapting to constraints, and keeping the platform stable while you're fundamentally changing how it works. It's messy and it's real and it's where you learn what you're actually made of.</p>
